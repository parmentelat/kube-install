this folder contains sample yaml files for running on the sopnode+r2lab combo

we use the kiada app that ships with book "Kubernetes in action - second edition"

for starters we play with the ability to select nodes for pods

* choosing a (any) R2lab node
* choosing a (any) sopnode box (actually choosing a non-R2lab node)
* choosing a (specific) R2lab node
